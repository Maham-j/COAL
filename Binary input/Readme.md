# 🚀 Program Overview

This assembly language program reads an 8-bit binary number from user input and stores it in the `BL` register.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input Handling:**  
   - Reads 8 binary digits (0 or 1) from the user.
   - Constructs an 8-bit binary number in the `BL` register.

2. **Bitwise Operations:**  
   - Uses bitwise shift and OR operations to assemble the binary number from the input digits.

3. **Program Exit:**  
   - Exits gracefully after processing 8 binary digits.

## 🔗 Usage

1. Run the program in a DOS environment.
2. Enter exactly 8 binary digits.
3. The binary number is stored in the `BL` register.

## 📦 Requirements

- **Processor:** 80386 or higher
- **Memory:** 256 bytes (minimum)
- **Assembler:** TASM/MASM
