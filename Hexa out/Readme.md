# Hexadecimal Output Program 🖥️

## Overview 📋
This program reads a binary value from the BX register and outputs it as a hexadecimal number. The program converts the binary value into its hexadecimal representation and displays it using standard output.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Initialization**:  
   The data segment is set up, and the BX register contains the binary value to be converted.

2. **Conversion to Hexadecimal**:  
   The program extracts each nibble (4-bit segment) from the binary value in the BX register:
   - Each nibble is converted to its corresponding hexadecimal digit.
   - The program handles both numerical digits (`0-9`) and letters (`A-F`).

3. **Output Handling**:  
   The hexadecimal digits are output to the console, showing the value in a human-readable hexadecimal format.

4. **Program Exit**:  
   The program exits when the conversion and output are complete.

## Usage 🛠️

1. Run the program.
2. Ensure the BX register contains the binary value to be converted.
3. The program will output the hexadecimal representation of the value.

## Notes 📝

- This program assumes the BX register is correctly loaded with the binary value before execution.
- The output will be displayed in uppercase hexadecimal format.

## Exit Condition 🔚

- The program exits gracefully after displaying the hexadecimal output.
