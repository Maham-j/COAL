# 🚀 Program Overview

This assembly language program reads 8 binary digits from user input and stores the resulting 8-bit binary number in the `BL` register.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input Handling:**  
   - Prompts the user to enter exactly 8 binary digits (0 or 1).
   - Assembles the binary number in the `BL` register by processing each digit.

2. **Bitwise Operations:**  
   - Utilizes bitwise shift and OR operations to construct the 8-bit binary number from the individual input digits.

3. **Binary Output:**  
   - The program displays the 8-bit binary number after processing the input digits.

4. **Program Exit:**  
   - Exits gracefully after processing and outputting the 8 binary digits.

## 🔗 Usage

1. Run the program in a DOS environment.
2. Enter exactly 8 binary digits (0 or 1) when prompted.
3. The program will store the binary number in the `BL` register and display it.

## 📦 Requirements

- **Processor:** 80386 or higher
